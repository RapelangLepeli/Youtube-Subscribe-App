# YoutubeSubscribeApp
* This is a selenuim project written in C# for chrome. It Allows you to auto subscribe to a list of youtube channels stored in a csv file in a format (channel Id, Channel Link, Channel Name). You can choose which attribute you want to use, but by default the program will use a channel name.
